## üîç About

`gentrans` is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool that leverages the power of Generative AI to provide high-quality text
translation directly in your terminal.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Direct Translation** - Translate text directly from command-line arguments.
- **Pipe Support** - Read text from standard input (stdin) to work seamlessly with pipes (`|`).
- **Multiple AI Providers** - Support for multiple AI providers (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini).
- **Model Selection** - Select specific models for translation.
- **Environment Variable Support** - Configure API keys and settings via environment variables.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

To run `gentrans`, you need to have **Java** installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17** or newer

---

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Download and Extract**
   Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hiroaki404/gentrans/releases) page and
   extract it.

2. **Add to PATH**
   Add the `bin` directory from the extracted folder to your system's PATH to make `gentrans` accessible from any
   terminal.

3. **Verify Installation**
   Run the following command to ensure it's installed correctly:
   ```bash
   gentrans --version
   ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Build from Source

For development or if you want to build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hiroaki404/gentrans.git
cd gentrans
./gradlew build
./build/install/gentrans/bin/gentrans --version
```

---

## Usage

### üí¨ Basic Translation

Provide the text you want to translate as an argument:

```bash
$ gentrans "„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ‰∏ñÁïå"
or
$ gentrans „Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ‰∏ñÁïå
# Expected: Hello, world
$ gentrans -t "ja" "Hello World"
```

### üîÄ Piping from Standard Input

Use `gentrans` as part of a command pipeline:

```bash
$ echo "CLI„ÉÑ„Éº„É´„ÅØÈñãÁô∫ËÄÖ„Å´„Å®„Å£„Å¶Âº∑Âäõ„Å™Ê≠¶Âô®„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ" | gentrans
# Expected: CLI tools are powerful weapons for developers.
```

Translate the content of a file:

```bash
$ cat document_ja.txt | gentrans > document_en.txt
```

### ü§ñ Specifying AI Provider and Model

You can specify the AI provider and model to use for translation.

```bash
# Use Gemini
$ gentrans --provider google "„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ"

# Use a specific OpenAI model
$ gentrans --provider openai --model gpt-4o "„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ"
```

---

## Configuration

Configuration can be done via command-line flags and environment variables.

Configuration settings are prioritized in the following order:

1. **Command-line flags** (highest priority)
2. **Environment variables**

This means that any setting provided as a command-line flag will override the corresponding environment variable.

If the provider or model is not specified, the following default values will be used:

- **Default Target Language**: `English`
- **Default Provider**: `openai`
- **Default Model**: `gpt-4o`

**Note:** Currently, `gentrans` does not support registering and switching between multiple providers or models. You can
only use one provider and model configuration at a time.

### Command-line flags:

- `--apikey`: Your secret API Key for the translation service.
- `--provider`: AI Provider to use. Supported providers are `google`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `meta`, `alibaba`,
  `openrouter`, and `ollama`.
- `--model`: AI model to use. This tool relies on the [Koog](https://github.com/JetBrains/koog) library, so only models
  supported by Koog can be used. For a detailed list, please refer to the official Koog documentation (
  e.g., [GoogleModels.kt](https://github.com/JetBrains/koog/blob/develop/prompt/prompt-executor/prompt-executor-clients/prompt-executor-google-client/src/commonMain/kotlin/ai/koog/prompt/executor/clients/google/GoogleModels.kt)).
  Representative models include `gemini-2.0-flash`, `gpt-4o`, `o3`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `claude-3-opus`, `claude-sonnet-4-0`,
  and `llama3.2:3b`.

### Environment variables:

- `GENTRANS_API_KEY`: Your secret API Key for the translation service.
- `GENTRANS_PROVIDER`: AI Provider to use (e.g., `openai`, `google`).
- `GENTRANS_MODEL`: AI model to use (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `gemini-2.0-flash`).

### Usage Examples:

```bash
# Using environment variables
export GENTRANS_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
export GENTRANS_PROVIDER="openai"
export GENTRANS_MODEL="gpt-4o"
gentrans "„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ‰∏ñÁïå"

# Using command-line flags (overrides environment variables)
gentrans --apikey "your-api-key" --provider "gemini" --model "gemini-2.0-flash" "„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ‰∏ñÁïå"
```

### ‚úÖ Verified Combinations

The following combinations of providers and models have been tested and are known to work:

| Provider | Model              |
|----------|--------------------|
| `openai` | `gpt-4o`           |
| `google` | `gemini-2.0-flash` |
| `ollama` | `llama3.2`         |

## üìñ Command Reference

### üåç Main Command: Translation

```
USAGE:
    gentrans [OPTIONS] [TEXT_TO_TRANSLATE]

ARGS:
    <TEXT_TO_TRANSLATE>    Text to translate. Reads from stdin if not provided.

        --model <MODEL>    AI model to use. Supported models depend on the Koog library. See documentation for details.
    -t, --to <LANGUAGE>    Specify the target language. Since the language is interpreted by an LLM, you can use various formats like `English`, `en`, or even `Êó•Êú¨Ë™û`.

## üöß Work In Progress (WIP)

The following features are planned but not yet implemented:

- **Flexible Configuration System:**
    - Configuration via a file (`~/.config/gentrans/config.toml`).
    - Multiple provider/model profiles with easy switching.
- **Advanced Translation Options:**
    - `-f`, `--from <LANGUAGE>`: Specify the source language.
    - `-s`, `--style <STYLE>`: Define the translation style (e.g., `formal`, `casual`).
- **`config` Subcommand:**
    - A dedicated command (`gentrans config`) to easily manage settings (`set`, `get`, `list`, `path`).
